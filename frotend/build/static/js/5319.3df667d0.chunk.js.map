We really appreciate your business and\r\n          your interest in our products. We want to make sure you have a good\r\n          experience purchasing from our webstore, CricketWeapon.com.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          As with any shopping experience, there are certain terms and\r\n          conditions that apply. By placing an order and purchasing a product\r\n          from our website, you agree to the terms below along with other terms\r\n          on our website, such as return and warranty policies, our privacy\r\n          policy, and terms of use. Please make sure to review everything fully\r\n          and carefully so you are informed about your rights and obligations.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Acceptance of These Terms</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          You (“Customer”) may place orders for Products with CricketWeapon\r\n          (\"we,\" \"our\") via our website. By placing an order, you consent to\r\n          these Terms and Conditions of Sale (“Terms”) and acknowledge that we\r\n          will furnish the Products subject to these Terms. Unless expressly\r\n          agreed to or set forth in writing by CricketWeapon, any term or\r\n          condition in any order or other form or correspondence that is in any\r\n          way inconsistent with these Terms shall be inapplicable and of no\r\n          force and effect whatsoever.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Orders</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          All orders are subject to CricketWeapon's acceptance. This means\r\n          CricketWeapon may, for any reason, refuse to accept or may cancel or\r\n          limit any order, or order quantity, whether or not the order has been\r\n          confirmed. Your receipt of an order confirmation does not mean our\r\n          acceptance of your order, nor is it a confirmation of our offer to\r\n          sell. We are simply confirming that we received your order. If we\r\n          cancel an order after you have already been charged, CricketWeapon\r\n          will refund you the charged amount.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Product Offering</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          All product descriptions on our website are subject to change at any\r\n          time without notice, at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to\r\n          change or discontinue a product at any time. We have made every effort\r\n          to display the colors and images of the products as accurately as\r\n          possible. However, we cannot guarantee that your device’s display of\r\n          any color will be accurate and a true reflection of the physical item\r\n          upon receipt.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Price</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          All prices are subject to change up to the time you place your order\r\n          and it is accepted by CricketWeapon. Prices for products displayed on\r\n          this website exclude shipping charges, which are calculated and\r\n          displayed depending on the shipping option for the item you select\r\n          when you finalize your purchase. Please note that the prices on this\r\n          website may differ from those in stores that stock CricketWeapon\r\n          products, as these stores are independent of CricketWeapon.\r\n          CricketWeapon reserves the right to amend pricing for any pricing\r\n          errors displayed due to human error, computer malfunction, or any\r\n          other reason. Where a pricing error is identified after you have\r\n          submitted an online order, CricketWeapon will notify you of the error\r\n          in pricing as soon as reasonably practicable, and you may elect to not\r\n          proceed with the purchase of any product(s) where the price has been\r\n          corrected.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Special Offers</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          From time to time, we may offer special promotions for some or all of\r\n          our products, including discounts, limited edition products, or free\r\n          shipping. These offers may be for a limited time only, and\r\n          CricketWeapon reserves the right to change or discontinue such offers\r\n          at any time.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Taxes</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The prices quoted for the products sold hereunder include applicable\r\n          taxes. Customer shall pay, and reimburse CricketWeapon if it pays, any\r\n          taxes, except for those based on CricketWeapon's income.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Payment</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          All orders must be paid in full prior to shipment. Payment information\r\n          is submitted by the customer upon the placement of any order, and\r\n          fulfillment and shipping of the order are subject to verification of\r\n          payment information and availability of funds.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Shipping</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Available shipping options will be displayed during the checkout\r\n          process. Any timeframe provided by CricketWeapon for when the\r\n          product(s) may ship or be delivered is a good faith estimate. While we\r\n          do our best to meet that timeframe, it is not a guarantee. Actual\r\n          delivery of your order can be impacted by many events, some of which\r\n          are beyond our control. CricketWeapon cannot be held liable for late\r\n          deliveries. If you no longer have use for an item due to a late\r\n          delivery, please contact our Customer Service Department immediately.\r\n          Please refer to our return policy for available options.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          All risk of loss or damage to the products shall pass to you, or a\r\n          person designated by you, upon taking physical possession of the\r\n          product(s). If items are lost or damaged in transit, please contact\r\n          our Customer Service Department.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Returns</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Once an order has been placed and accepted by CricketWeapon, customer\r\n          may not cancel such accepted order without CricketWeapon’s prior\r\n          written consent. Customer may return products for a refund of the\r\n          purchase price (not including initial shipping charges) plus any\r\n          applicable tax. Customer shall arrange for and pay return shipping\r\n          expenses. The product(s) must be returned to CricketWeapon within\r\n          thirty days of purchase.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Warranty</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          For more information regarding our warranty policy, please refer to\r\n          the written warranty included with the product.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Not for Resale</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Products sold on our website are for end-user customers only and not\r\n          for resale. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order if we\r\n          suspect you are purchasing products for resale.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Governing Law/ Jurisdiction</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the\r\n          laws of Singapore.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Dispute Resolution and Applicable Law</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          This Agreement is to be governed by and construed in accordance with\r\n          all applicable laws in force in Singapore from time to time.
